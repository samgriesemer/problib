class Candidate:
  '''
  Base candidate class for evolutionary algorithms
  NOTE: can always consider switching the constructor to
  by default take random attributes and yield a stochastic
  candidate. This might make sense if we are to strictly
  follow what is most commonly used. However, it's not
  obvious how to go from specified genotype into a constructor
  expecting parameters for random generation; this would certainly
  be more sloppy than the current simple entry point constructor.

  Want to separate candidate from agent. Candidates dont need to be 
  defined in the context of a gym evnironment. They just hold a genotype
  and inherit the basic functions seen in base

    TODO: consider how this is being done; should a nn object
    be kept in memory at all times and modifications be made
    directly to its weights so come inference time everything is
    ready to go? This seems a little bulky but may end up being
    more efficient. Initializing a network each time from weights
    though has a tiny overhead; it just sets the nn object's weights
    and no additional computation is needed.
    Also how are we going to pass the incoming data to the network
    for the actual inference procedure? Should the data be set to
    the network itself, passed to the function, or set under the
    candidate object?
