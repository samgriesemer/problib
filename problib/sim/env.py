class Env():
    '''
    Base environment class outlining simple tick, draw, and create methods. All
    environments to be used inside a Gym or interacting with Agent types
    should inherit this interface. Need to provide a state and action space
    for defining valid actions and return states.

    Environments encompass all of the components necessary for action execution.
    Environments should be independent of the agents interacting with it; it is not
    concerned with how the agents make decisions but only how to execute submitted
    actions against ingrained constraints.

    This environment module is designed with multi agent systems in mind. Environments
    don't have to be crafted with specific elements and logic built-in. The implementation
    intends to be general enough to allow for factory object registration; this is often
    important when creating or changing an agents representation in the simulation at run time
    or dynamically before hand. This is where the library differs from existing implementations
    like OpenAI's gym library; it uses a more general and flexible approach.
