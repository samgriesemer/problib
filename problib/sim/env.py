class Env():
    '''
    Base environment class outlining `tick` and `create` methods. All environments used
    within a Gym or interacting with Agent types should inherit this interface. The state
    space is implicitly defined by the internal update/management logic within `tick`,
    while the action space needs to be provided (and known internally by) the inheriting
    environment.

    Environments encompass all of the components necessary for action execution.
    Environments should be independent of the agents interacting with it; it is not
    concerned with how the agents make decisions but only how to execute submitted actions
    against ingrained constraints.

    This environment module is designed with multi-agent systems in mind.

    This class is the defining component of the multi-agent system simulation framework.
    It is the highest level of abstraction in the environment creation complexity chain,
    laying out the core components common to all functioning downstream environments.
    Subclassing this interface is akin to creating an engine: defining some core
    structure/substrate, a space of possible entities that can exist within this
    substrate, and a set of constraints both among entities and between entities and the
    core structure.
